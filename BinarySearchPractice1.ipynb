    "\n",
    "> You are given list of numbers, obtained by rotating a sorted list an unknown number of times. Write a function to determine the minimum number of times the original sorted list was rotated to obtain the given list. Your function should have the worst-case complexity of `O(log N)`, where N is the length of the list. You can assume that all the numbers in the list are unique.\n",

    "> Example: The list `[5, 6, 9, 0, 2, 3, 4]` was obtained by rotating the sorted list `[0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9]` 3 times.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> We define \"rotating a list\" as removing the last element of the list and adding it before the first element. E.g. rotating the list `[3, 2, 4, 1]` produces `[1, 3, 2, 4]`. \n",

    ">\"Sorted list\" refers to a list where the elements are arranged in the increasing order  e.g. `[1, 3, 5, 7]`.\n",

    "1. State the problem clearly. Identify the input & output formats.\n",
    "2. Come up with some example inputs & outputs. Try to cover all edge cases.\n",
